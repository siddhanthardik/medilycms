# MEDILY Deployment Guide

This guide covers the deployment requirements and fixes applied to ensure successful production deployment.

## Applied Fixes

The following fixes have been implemented to resolve deployment issues:

### 1. Environment Variable Validation
- ✅ Added NODE_ENV=production environment variable detection
- ✅ Added validation for required environment variables (DATABASE_URL)
- ✅ Added graceful error handling when environment variables are missing
- ✅ Added proper logging for environment variable verification

### 2. Static File Serving Improvements
- ✅ Enhanced static file serving with proper cache headers
- ✅ Fixed build directory structure to work with production environment
- ✅ Created post-build script to copy static assets to correct location
- ✅ Added error handling for missing build files

### 3. Server Initialization Error Handling
- ✅ Added comprehensive error logging for server startup failures
- ✅ Implemented graceful shutdown handlers (SIGTERM, SIGINT)
- ✅ Added better error reporting for debugging deployment issues
- ✅ Enhanced startup logging to track initialization progress

### 4. Build Process Enhancements
- ✅ Verified build script creates correct directory structure
- ✅ Added deployment preparation script for pre-deployment checks
- ✅ Implemented static file copying process for production
- ✅ Added build verification and health checks

## Deployment Requirements

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database
```

### Optional Environment Variables
```bash
NODE_ENV=production        # Automatically enables production mode
PORT=5000                 # Server port (defaults to 5000)
```

## Deployment Process

### 1. Build the Application
```bash
npm run build
```

### 2. Prepare Static Files
```bash
node scripts/post-build.js
```

### 3. Run Deployment Check
```bash
node scripts/prepare-deployment.js
```

### 4. Start Production Server
```bash
NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js
```

## File Structure (Production)
```
dist/
├── index.js              # Compiled server code
└── public/               # Built client assets (from Vite)

server/
└── public/               # Static files for production serving
    ├── index.html
    └── assets/
        ├── *.js
        ├── *.css
        └── *.jpg
```

## Health Check Endpoints

- `GET /api/auth/user` - Authentication check
- `GET /` - Application root (serves React app)

## Startup Logs (Production)
When starting successfully, you should see:
```
Production environment variables verified
Setting up production environment with static file serving
Server successfully started on port 5000
Environment: production
Server ready to accept connections
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build Directory Not Found
```bash
# Run the build process
npm run build

# Copy static files
node scripts/post-build.js
```

### Missing Environment Variables
```bash
# Check required variables are set
echo $DATABASE_URL
```

### Static Files Not Serving
- Ensure `server/public/` directory exists with built assets
- Check that `npm run build` completed successfully
- Verify post-build script ran without errors

## Deployment Platform Configuration

### Replit Deployments
- Set environment variables in the Secrets tab
- The build and start commands are configured in package.json
- Static files are automatically served by the Express server

### Build Commands
- Build: `npm run build`
- Start: `NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js`

## Database Setup
- Database migrations run automatically on server startup
- Ensure DATABASE_URL points to accessible PostgreSQL instance
- Database tables will be created if they don't exist

## Performance Considerations
- Static files are served with 1-year cache headers
- Built assets are minified and optimized
- Database connections are pooled for efficiency

## Security Features
- HTTPS termination handled by deployment platform
- Environment variables secured as deployment secrets
- Database credentials never exposed in code
- Session security configured for production environment
