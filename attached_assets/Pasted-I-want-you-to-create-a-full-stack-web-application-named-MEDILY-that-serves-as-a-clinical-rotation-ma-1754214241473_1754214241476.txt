I want you to create a full-stack web application named MEDILY that serves as a clinical rotation marketplace for medical professionals. This platform will help users find short-term clinical experiences such as:

Clerkships

Observerships

Fellowships

Hands-on training



---

ü©∫ Objective: To build a user-friendly platform similar to AMOpportunities.org, allowing healthcare professionals to find and apply for rotations based on subject specialty, location, duration, availability, and intake session. It should also provide an admin backend to manage inventory and users.


---

üîê User Roles:

1. Medical Professional (User)

Sign up / Sign in / Forgot password

Browse available clinical rotations

Search & filter by specialty, country, duration, dates, availability, session intake, seat count, paid/free

Apply/book a rotation

View booking status, past rotations

Profile management



2. Admin (Super Admin + Sub-admins)

Sign in to a secure admin dashboard

Add, update, or delete rotation listings

Block or close listings when full

Manage users, bookings, and payments

Assign roles to sub-admins (with access rights like view-only, edit, or manage-users)

View analytics: most viewed programs, booking rate, user demographics





---

üß† Features & Functionality:

Frontend (HTML, CSS, JS/React preferred):

Clean UI/UX for medical professionals

Search bar with filters (specialty, city/country, duration, availability, intake months, cost)

Program details page with full info: hospital/clinic name, mentor/doctor name, duration, location, fee, hands-on/observership, available seats

Secure user authentication

Responsive design for mobile/desktop


Backend (Node.js + Express.js OR Django preferred):

User authentication (JWT/token-based)

REST APIs for program listings, user data, admin controls

Session tracking and booking engine

Payment gateway integration (Stripe/PayPal - dummy for now)


Database:

MongoDB / PostgreSQL

Tables/Collections for: Users, Programs, Bookings, Admins, Reviews, Specialties


Admin Panel (simple and functional):

üßë‚Äçüíº Business Strategy Simulation: Assume I have previously worked at AMOpportunities.org. Now I want to launch MEDILY with a more flexible, user-friendly, and partner-driven approach where hospitals and mentors can also log in and post their rotation availability directly (for future roadmap). This version should have provision for future scalability.


---

üéØ Goal: This app should be fully deployable on Replit, with all major routes, user journeys, and admin flows in place. Ensure modularity in code for future extension (e.g., mentor accounts, multi-language support, WhatsApp integration).


---

üîñ Tech Stack Suggestion:

Frontend: React.js or HTML/CSS/JS with Bootstrap/Tailwind

Backend: Express.js (Node) or Django

Database: MongoDB or PostgreSQL

Authentication: JWT

Deployment: Replit hosting with .env support

Optional: Firebase for notifications



---

üìÅ Deliverables:

1. Working app on Replit with frontend + backend


2. Live demo link


3. README with instructions to run locally and deploy


4. Sample admin credentials


5. Seed data for testing (5-10 rotation listings)




---

üß™ Example Rotation Listing Fields:

Program Title

Type: Observership / Hands-on / Fellowship

Specialty

Location (City, Country)

Hospital/Clinic Name

Mentor Name

Start Date

Duration (in weeks)

Intake Months

Available Seats

Fees

Hands-on Access: Yes/No

Description

Requirements (e.g., MBBS/USMLE etc.)



---

üéØ Name the App: MEDILY
üì£ Tagline: Empowering Global Medical Careers

Now go ahead and build this full project on Replit with the above scope. Start with user auth, listing database, and search filters. Use placeholder data where needed. Final app should be intuitive, functional, and scalable for real-world launch.
